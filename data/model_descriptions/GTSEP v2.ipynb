    "This model is the same as v2 but with the following changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of letting the model choose freely how much to generate between p_min and p_max at all times, I instead want to force the model to generate at a certain capacity $\\in [0,1]$ of p_max during a specificed time_period. I should develop the theory to work for arbitrary time periods, but I will start by using a weekly time period. This means that if a solar panel has a weekly capacity utilization of say 0.50, then it will produce p_max * 0.5 * capacity_factor at each time step during that week. I.e. the utilization cannot be changed continously. There are no ramping constraints between weeks. "
